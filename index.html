        I'm a passionate and experienced software engineer with a wide range of professional experience. I'm an advocate for accessibility, 
        a capable teacher, and a fast learner. I'm a problem solver who quickly delivers quality solutions to any type of problem, the harder, 
        the better.
    </p>
    <p>
    I love what I do. I’m someone who still has a blast creating software and loves watching users use it.
    </p>
<p>
    I'm an engineer by day and hand drummer by night (or I was,

    <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140106024618/http://padulaoblongata.com/">band</a> broke up).
	I am also Maker's Mark Ambassador #1726391. Now if that doesn't impress you, I don't know what will.
    As you can tell from this stunning page, my design sensibilities are pretty much
    Google circa 2000.

    <h2>Clavistry</h2>
    <p>
        <a href="https://eschiebel.github.io/Clavistry">Clavistry</a> is a web drum machine that plays Afro-Caribbean rhythms. It's a React app
        built with vite and uses web audio for the audio engine. The rhythms are represented
        as tablature in json files. You can mute individual parts and play along!
    
    <p>
        I’ve been looking forward to building this for a while. With AI’s help I had a working app by the end of the day, something 
        fairly polished within three, and in its current state within a week. I wouldn't say it was easy, 
        but it certainly was fast. AI wrote most of the code, and while I understand what’s 
        going on under the hood, I don’t know it as deeply as I would’ve if I’d built it solo. 
        I guess this is what it means to be a software engineer now.
    </p>
    <p>
       Clavistry is still very much a work in progress. Keep checking back and see what's new. Some plans include:
        <ul>
            <li>Adding more rhythms. Maybe organizing them by country of origin?</li>
            <li>Adding more samples.</li>
            <li>Adding a way to edit or upload new rhythms.</li>
        </ul>

<h2>Breakout</h2>
<p>
    In a previous job I was building a pretty complex single page app using React, 
    and was pleased with its performance. I was curious though. Could
    React be used to build an arcade game, albeit a simple one.
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakout_(video_game)">Breakout</a>
    is a classic old school game I liked back in the day, and with limited moving parts
    there was a reasonable chance both React and I would be successful.
</p><p>
    Along with <a href="https://react.dev/">React</a>, I'm using
    <a href="http://alt.js.org/">Alt</a> for my Flux actions and stores implementation,
    (remember when <i>Flux</i> was a thing?) and I'm keeping all the game's state in
    <a href="https://immutable-js.com/">Immutable data structures</a>.
    The game pieces are all <code>divs</code> absolutely positioned on the <i>court</i>. Game play
    is handled by calculating the position of the ball, paddle,
    and the state of the bricks in the wall every tick of <code>requestAnimationFrame</code>, which
    <code>GameStore</code> saves away in its state. The top-level component, <code>Breakout</code>, listens for
    <code>GameStore</code> changes, and renders the field of play.
</p><p>
    The verdict is, yes, React's virtual DOM can mostly keep up. The game plays pretty well.
</p><p>
    By now, I bet you're curious. You can play it <a href="breakout/index.html">right here</a>.  Game play is
    dead simple, and there are a zillion things I could do to make it more interesting as a game, but
    that wasn't the point.
