<h1>Ed Schiebel</h1>
<p>
    I'm a developer by day and hand drummer by night (or I was,
    <a href="https://www.facebook.com/padula.oblongata/">the</a>
    <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140106024618/http://padulaoblongata.com/">band</a> broke up).
    As you can tell from this stunning page, my design sensibilities are pretty much
    Google circa 2000.
</p>
<h2>Breakout</h2>
<p>
    I've been building a pretty complex single page app using React at my
    day job, and have been pleased with its performance. I was curious though. Could
    React be used to build a video game, albeit a simple one.
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakout_(video_game)">Breakout</a>
    is a classic old school game I liked back in the day, and with limited moving parts
    there was a reasonable chance both React and I would be successful.
</p><p>
    Along with <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/">React</a>, I'm using
    <a href="http://alt.js.org/">Alt</a> for my Flux actions and stores implementation,
    and I'm keeping all the game's state in
    <a href="https://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/">Immutable data structures</a>.
    The game pieces are all <code>divs</code> absolutely positioned on the <i>court</i>. Game play
    is handled by calculating the position of the ball, paddle,
    and the state of the bricks in the wall every tick of <code>requestAnimationFrame</code>, which
    <code>GameStore</code> saves away in its state. The top-level component, <code>Breakout</code>, listens for
    <code>GameStore</code> changes, and renders the field of play.
</p><p>
    The verdict is, yes, React's virtual DOM can keep up. The game plays well in chrome
    and ie11. Firefox glitches off and on, and can't keep the ball rendered on the
    screen if it gets moving too fast (which I don't understand yet, since it's being drawn
    the same number of times no matter how fast it's moving). I'd like to figure out what's going on there.
</p><p>
    By now, I bet you're curious. You can play it <a href="breakout/index.html">right here</a>.  Game play is
    dead simple, and there are a zillion things I could do to make it more interesting as a game, but
    that wasn't the point. (Though every weekend the dog gets me up a good 2-3 hours before my wife,
    so I bet there will be some tinkering going on.)
